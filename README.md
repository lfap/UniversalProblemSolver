# UniversalProblemSolver

Have you ever solved a problem/bug or a problem that take too many time?
And when you finally solved it the only thing you wanted to do is to move on to the next task?
And have you ever faced the same problem/bug again and couldn't remember how you managed to solved it in the first time?

It heppens to me more than I would like.

So I created this repository to store some of those problems and solutions that worked for me, as a 'handbook'.

Also I'll put some tips that halped me in the past and other things that I think it's interesting leaving around.

Any suggestion feel free to contact me.
